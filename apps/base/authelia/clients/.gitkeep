# OIDC Clients Directory
#
# This directory contains OIDC client definitions for Authelia.
# Each client should have its own ConfigMap and SealedSecret.
#
# To add a new OIDC client:
# 1. Copy example-client.yaml.template to <client-name>.yaml
# 2. Generate a client secret and create a SealedSecret
# 3. Update the main configuration.yml to include the client
# 4. Add both files to kustomization.yaml resources
#
# See README.md for detailed instructions.
