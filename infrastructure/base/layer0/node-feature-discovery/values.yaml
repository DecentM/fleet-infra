      # You may want to use the same value for `requests.memory` and `limits.memory`. The “requests” value affects scheduling to accommodate pods on nodes.
      # If there is a large difference between “requests” and “limits” and nodes experience memory pressure, the kernel may invoke
      # the OOM Killer, even if the memory does not exceed the “limits” threshold. This can cause unexpected pod evictions. Memory
      # cannot be compressed and once allocated to a pod, it can only be reclaimed by killing the pod.
